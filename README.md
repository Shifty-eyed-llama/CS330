1. How do I approach designing software?
  -  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  -  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  -  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    I think that one of the most important steps when designing software is to identify the problem and requirements. Even though requirements may change,
    it is important to start from a place where you know what you are doing and what goal you are aiming for, if the requirements change along the way it is
    easier to pivot and reach for the new goal with a solid foundation. I think that the master code was useful in this course as it shows an example of what 
    was to be built, and that gave a good footing from which to reach for a finished project.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
   - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3d scene?
   - How did iteration factor into your development?
   - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led youto the project's completion?
  
     Developing in small steps was definitly a strategy that I embraced. Building a scene one triangle at a time is slow, but it really helps to watch
     the scene come together. Through iteration, and the painstaking process of placing one triangle after another, you could see a scene start to form.
     Unfortunatly, I think that the pace of the course from milestone to milestone left me struggling to grasp all the concepts that were being used,
     I found myself without a solid foundation, kicking frantically against an angry sea.
  
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
     Computer graphics and visualizations was an interesting class and I feel like I have gained a lot. This is not an easy level of applying software
     and building complexity is the best way to grow in a chosen field. The complexity of this class is a way of preparing for even more complex learning
     opportunities in the future. As I hope to work in the field of computer science upon graduation, the tasks will only become more comples and I am
     prepared now to learn and grow with the challenges.
